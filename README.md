ðŸŒŸ Hi, I'm Kiran !!

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve embarked on an exciting journey to master Front-End Development! As someone whoâ€™s always been fascinated by the way websites come to life, I decided it was time to dive deep and learn the skills that make it happen.

ðŸ’» Why Front-End Development?
The world of web design and interactivity has always inspired me. From crafting visually stunning layouts with HTML & CSS to bringing pages to life with JavaScript, the possibilities are endlessâ€”and Iâ€™m here to explore them all!

ðŸ“– What Iâ€™ve Done So Far:

Learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Explored how the internet works and the role of web servers
Started building simple projects to apply my skills

ðŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™ll be documenting every step of my learning journey here on LinkedIn and sharing my progress, notes, and projects. My first deep dive is into How the Web Works

ðŸ“Œ Follow along if youâ€™re interested in web development, or if youâ€™re just curious about my progress. Letâ€™s connect, share knowledge, and grow together!

ðŸ™Œ Cheers to new beginnings and continuous learning!
