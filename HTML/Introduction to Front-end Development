# Module 1: How the Web Works

## How the Internet Works

### Key Concepts:
- **Search and Internet Speed**: The Internet enables users to search for information and receive responses almost instantly due to advanced networking and data transfer systems.
- **Network**: A connection between two or more devices, enabling data sharing and collaboration via wired or wireless links.
- **Network Switch**: A device connecting multiple devices within a network for effective communication. Large networks are formed by linking switches.
- **Internet**: A vast, interconnected network created by linking smaller networks, enabling global communication and information sharing.
- **Client**: Devices like smartphones or laptops that access services, websites, or applications provided by servers.
- **Server**: Computers or systems that host websites, applications, or services, making them accessible to clients.
- **Client-Server Model**: A structure where servers provide resources or services, and clients access them through the Internet.

### Internet Overview:
The Internet connects devices through networks and switches, supported by global infrastructure such as servers and undersea cables. Despite its technical complexity, it facilitates seamless global communication.

## What is a Web Server and How Does It Work?

### Key Components:

- **Server**: A computer running applications and services (e.g., websites, messaging). Servers are housed in data centers to provide consistent service.
- **Data Center**:
  - Facilities housing hundreds or thousands of servers.
  - Provide continuous power, stable internet connections, and a cool environment.
  - Strategically located worldwide to offer quick content access.

### Server Infrastructure:

1. **Hardware**:
   - Physical components like hard drives, processors, and memory.
   - Tailored for specific tasks (e.g., high storage for image servers, fast processors for computation-heavy tasks).
2. **Software**:
   - Code running on server hardware.
   - Easier to modify through updates compared to physical hardware changes.

### Web Server Functions:

- **Definition**: A web server is software providing services such as:
  - Website storage and management.
  - Data storage.
  - Security.
  - Email management.
- **Primary Role**: Handling web requests and delivering requested content to users.

### Request-Response Cycle:

- **Web Request**: Initiated when a user enters a website address in a browser.
- **Server Response**: Delivers website content to the userâ€™s device.
- **Cycle Overview**: A client sends a request to the server, which processes it and responds with the requested data. Web servers are designed to handle thousands of requests per second.

### Summary:

A web server consists of both hardware and software. Its primary role is to process and respond to web requests efficiently, ensuring a seamless user experience.
