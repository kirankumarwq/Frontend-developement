# Module Summary - Get Started with Web Development

## 1. Overview of How the Web Works
You began by understanding how the web functions and the key components involved, including:
- **Web Pages**
- **Web Servers**
- **Web Browsers**

---

## 2. Web Pages
- **Web Page vs. Website**: You can now outline the key elements that distinguish a **website** (a collection of web pages) from an individual **web page**.
- **HTML & CSS**: You should now be able to explain the purpose of **HTML** (structure) and **CSS** (style), and how they work together to create a web page.
- **JavaScript**: You learned how **JavaScript** adds interactivity and allows data processing on web pages, enhancing their functionality.

---

## 3. Web Servers
- **Data Centers**: You explored how a **data center** provides the necessary storage and power for web servers.
- **Server Hardware vs. Software**: You can now differentiate between the **physical hardware** and **software** that run web servers.
- **HTTP**: You’ve learned how web servers handle requests through **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol), and how requests and responses work between clients and servers.

---

## 4. Web Browsers
- **What is a Web Browser?**: You can now describe what a **web browser** is and how it receives content from web servers to display it to users.
- **Request-Response Cycle**: You now understand the cycle through which web browsers send requests and receive responses from web servers.

---

## 5. Core Internet Technologies
- **IP Addresses**: You learned how **IP addresses** are crucial for transferring data across the internet.
- **HTTP Functions**: You now understand how **HTTP** operates, the common **HTTP methods**, and how it supports communication between clients and servers.
- **Interaction of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: You explored how these three technologies work together to generate web pages, with **HTML** providing structure, **CSS** styling, and **JavaScript** adding interactivity.

---

## 6. Web Apps
- **Web Page vs. Website vs. Web App**: You can now differentiate between a **web page**, a **website**, and a **web app**.
- **Front End & Back End**: You learned the distinction between the **front end** (user interface) and **back end** (server-side operations) of a web app.
- **Developer Tools**: You should now be familiar with common web browser developer tools for debugging and optimizing web apps.

---

## 7. Libraries & Frameworks
You gained an understanding of **libraries** and **frameworks** in development, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they help streamline and accelerate development.

---

## 8. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
You’ve learned how **APIs** are used in application development to extend functionality or connect different systems.

---

## 9. IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
You explored the purpose of an **IDE**, its features, and how it aids in more efficient coding with tools like **syntax highlighting**, **error checking**, and **refactoring**.
