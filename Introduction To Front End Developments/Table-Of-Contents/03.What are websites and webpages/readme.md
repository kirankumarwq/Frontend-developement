# What Are Websites and Webpages?

## Key Concepts

### Web Page
- A web page is a document that displays content such as images, text, videos, and multimedia elements in a web browser.

### Website
- A website is a collection of interlinked web pages that share a common web address (URL) and purpose. For example, a homepage might link to articles or other pages within the same website.

### Links
- Links on a webpage can connect to pages within the same website or to entirely different websites, as seen in search engine results that direct users to multiple external websites.

### Web Page Creation Rate
- The Internet is constantly growing, with thousands of websites launched daily. Over a week, the number of new web pages can be comparable to the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza (2.3 million).

### Web Page Structure

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**:
   - Structures the content of the webpage using markup tags. These tags define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and multimedia.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
   - Provides styling, such as colors, layouts, and fonts, to enhance the appearance of HTML content.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - A programming language that enables interactivity, real-time updates, and dynamic features like form validation or live content updates.

### Analogy for Web Page Components
- **HTML**: The buildingâ€™s structure.
- **CSS**: The decoration and landscaping.
- **JavaScript**: The activities and interactivity within the building.

### JavaScript Features
- JavaScript processes data, controls actions, and adds interactivity to a webpage, making it more engaging and dynamic.

### Page Rendering
- **Definition**: The process by which a web browser interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code sequentially to visually display a webpage.
- The browser builds the page step by step as it reads the code, creating the visual representation users see.

### Server and Web Browser Interaction
- A web server sends a complete copy of a webpage to the browser, which processes the code and renders the page for display. This is part of the request-response cycle.

## Conclusion
- A web page relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working together to create and render content.
- Developers build websites using these tools, contributing to the rapidly expanding Internet.
- The role of the browser is critical in translating code into a visual and interactive experience.
