# Understanding Web Pages, Websites, and Web Applications

When working online, it’s essential to understand the distinctions between web pages, websites, and web applications, as well as how their features influence a developer's decision to create one. Below is an overview of their key features and differences.

## 1. Web Pages

**Definition**: A web page is a single document on the web, typically composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features**:
- Displays static content such as text, images, videos, or links.
- Limited interactivity; often focuses on delivering information.

**Examples**:
- A blog post.
- A contact page.

**Use Case**: Ideal for delivering simple, static information to users.

## 2. Websites

**Definition**: A website is a collection of interlinked web pages that share a single domain name.

**Features**:
- Organizes content across multiple pages.
- Provides navigation between pages using hyperlinks.
- May include both static and interactive elements.

**Examples**:
- An encyclopedia website where clicking links leads to different articles.
- A company website with multiple sections (About, Services, Contact).

**Hyperlinks**: Links between pages are called hyperlinks, and they may point to:
- Pages within the same website.
- Pages on external websites.

## 3. Web Applications

**Definition**: A web application is an interactive program that runs in a web browser, providing dynamic and user-specific content.

**Features**:
- Focus on user interaction and functionality.
- Content adapts based on user input (e.g., account details, preferences).
- Often more complex than a website, involving backend servers and databases.

**Examples**:
- Online food ordering systems.
- Social media platforms.
- Cloud-based tools like Google Docs.

**Dynamic Content**: Content changes based on the user or input (e.g., a personalized menu for a food delivery app). This contrasts with websites, where content is usually the same for all users.
