# Web Hosting

## Definition
- Web hosting is a service that allows individuals or companies to store their website and files on web servers owned by hosting providers.
- It eliminates the need to own a data center and provides stable, secure storage for websites.

## Types of Web Hosting Services

### 1. Shared Hosting
- **Description**: The most affordable option where multiple hosting accounts share the same physical server, including its CPU, memory, and bandwidth.
- **Use Case**: Best for small websites with low visitor traffic or for developers testing personal projects.
- **Limitations**: Shared resources may cause slower performance; free plans often include ads and restrictions.

### 2. Virtual Private Server (VPS)
- **Description**: A virtualized server with dedicated resources like CPU, memory, and bandwidth for each account. Multiple VPS instances may run on the same hardware, but each operates independently.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for websites with moderate traffic or greater resource needs than shared hosting.
- **Advantages**: Fixed resources ensure consistent performance.
- **Limitations**: Costs more than shared hosting.

### 3. Dedicated Hosting
- **Description**: Provides exclusive access to an entire physical server for one user. All resources, including CPU, memory, and bandwidth, are allocated solely to the user.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for large websites or web applications requiring significant resources and high performance.
- **Advantages**: Complete control with no resource sharing.
- **Limitations**: Significantly more expensive than VPS hosting.

### 4. Cloud Hosting
- **Description**: Uses a network of physical and virtual servers to host websites. If one server fails, the website automatically switches to another, ensuring uptime and reliability.
- **Use Case**: Best for scalable web applications or websites with unpredictable traffic.
- **Advantages**: Flexibility to use resources as needed without being limited by hardware.
- **Limitations**: Costs are usage-based, which can increase with high traffic or data transfers.
